 # Google-Play-Stats
 
I made this software as an internship project for Cyberace Infovision Pvt. Ltd.   
The domain of the project is Python and basics of Machine Learning  
The tasks that were assigned to me can be found [here](https://github.com/farhankapadia/Google-Play_Stats/blob/master/problem-statement/ProjectFlow.txt)    
The project required me to create a Graphical User Interface using **tkinter** and perform data wrangling and manipulation tasks using **pandas**.  
I also had to use a couple of basic Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression for which I made use of **sklearn**  
The various models used are listed here:  
* pandas
* tkinter
* seaborn
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib  

Before you can run this project, make sure you have all these modules installed.  
To install simply:  
```python

```   
followed by the name of the module you need to install.  

In order to run the project, run the file named `main.py`
